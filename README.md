Some Face Recognition Projects to Share with the World üåêüë§
Hey there! I've got a couple of face recognition projects that I've decided to share with you. Enjoy exploring these projects! üòä

How to use the scripts:
--FACE_RECOG.PY-- 
How to Use the Face Detection Script
This Python script utilizes the face_recognition library to detect faces in an image and visualize the face locations using matplotlib.

Prerequisites:
Python Installed: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Required Libraries: Install the required Python libraries using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install face_recognition matplotlib pillow

Download the Script:
Run the Script in the Terminal/Command Prompt:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
cd path/to/script/directory
Run the script using the following command:
python face_detection.py
Enter Image Path

The script will prompt you to enter the file path of the image you want to analyze.
Provide the full path or relative path to the image when prompted.
View Face Detection Results:

The script will analyze the image and display it with rectangles around the detected faces using matplotlib.
If no faces are found, it will print "No faces found in the image."

--PEOPLE_COMPARE.PY--
Prerequisites:
Install Required Libraries:
pip install face_recognition matplotlib dlib

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
cd path/to/script/directory
Run the script using the following command:
python script_name.py
Enter Image Paths
The script will prompt you to enter the file paths of the two images you want to compare.
Provide the full paths or relative paths to the images when prompted.
View Results:

The script will analyze the images, compare faces, and display the results.
If the same person is detected in both images, it will print "The same person is detected."
If different people are detected, it will print "Different people are detected."

--VIDEO_FACE_RECO.PY--
This Python script uses OpenCV and face_recognition to detect faces in a video and display the results in real-time. Optionally, you can save the processed video.

Prerequisites:
Install Required Libraries: 
pip install opencv-python face_recognition

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
cd path/to/script/directory
Run the script using the following command:
python script_name.py
Enter Video File Path and Output Path (Optional):

Enter the file path of the video when prompted.
Optionally, provide the path where you want to save the processed video. Press Enter to skip saving.
View Face Detection in Real-Time:

The script will read the video, detect faces, and display the processed video in real-time.
Detected faces will be highlighted with rectangles.

Thanks for chatgpt for writing the instructions, i was too lazy to do it myself...
Hope you'll enjoy (:
